UPDATE AO 22 MAR 2022

I made corrections to give the website more functionality. The next step in refining this website is to store the feedback from the survey posted on the feedback page (page 3). Fellow Software Developers I invite you to comment and give your feedback for making this better and code cleaner.

This is the code for the first website built from scratch.  During the course of two weeks students in the STEP-IT-UP
program learned and used HTML, CSS, and Javascript software languages to design their webpages. 
Showcasing their results the codes here were used in a local host setting.
Some of the features and designs may differ when opened in open public web browser.
All comments, suggetstions and reccomendations are welcome.
