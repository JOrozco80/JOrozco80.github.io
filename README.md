# JOrozco80.github.io
This is the code for the first website built from scratch.  During the course of two weeks students in the STEP-IT-UP
program learned and used HTML, CSS, and Javascript software languages to design their webpages. 
Showcasing their results the codes here were used in a local host setting.
Some of the features and designs may differ when opened in open public web browser.
All comments, suggetstions and reccomendations are welcome.
